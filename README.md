## Intro

*[Deskmat is called Mizu Deskmat: Water]*

Ordered in September 2020 and received a month later, this keyboard was bought from [Little Keyboards](https://www.littlekeyboards.com/collections/corne-pcb-kits/products/corne-mx-hotswap-pcb-kit-v3) with assembly service included since I did not have the tools nor the confidence to solder the board flawlessly ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸.

A short summary of the details that have been changed:

| General detail               | Description                                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Layers are kept the same way | `QWERTY`, `LOWER`, `RAISE` and `ADJUST`                           |
| OLED print orientation       | `270deg` -- facing the user (I don't wanna twist my head ðŸ™ƒ )     |
| Customized `glcdfont`        | Logos and indicators have been removed and replaced. |

## How to run

### Default keymap

This is for a normal / home / everyday keymap layout:

```bash
# Left side
make crkbd:lazyproof:dfu-split-left

# Right side
make crkbd:lazyproof:dfu-split-right
```

### Code keymap

For coding on an OSX environment with shortcuts meant for web debugging: 

```bash
make crkbd:lazyproof:dfu-split-left|right TEMPLATE=code
```

### Discord

For a one-sided keyboard that acts as an emoji dashboard:

```bash
make crkbd:lazyproof:dfu-split-right TEMPLATE=discord SIDE=right
```
